' GoodyChest is an example that creates chests filled with random
' items throughout the world, according to a probability of
' appearing per chunk.

' Note: This example picks a random item from Substrate's ItemTable,
' which includes all items up to the current version of MC (if Substrate
' itself is up to date).  If a chest gets filled with some of these
' latest items and gets opened in an older MC client, MC will crash.
